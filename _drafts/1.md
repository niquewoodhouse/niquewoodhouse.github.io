					<h2>Sprint from the start</h2>
					<p class="">
						Some old colleagues are launching their own product - Gigbloc. They want a product design and brand to share with potential investors.  
					</p>
					<p class="">
						Constraints can help create simple solutions.  With this project I had minimal time - a week of evenings - and no real budget.  That makes a great opportunity to see what I can do after my day job, working in a minified <a href="https://designsprintkit.withgoogle.com/" target="_blank" class="underline">design sprint</a>.

					<h2>Diverge</h2>
					<p class="">
						I've always liked to sketch out concepts individually, but I've learned that this group stage .  What I liked about this phase is it proves good ideas can come from anyone on the team, and the team can make any idea better by collaborating upfront. 
					</p>
					<p>
					 It's like (*insert bad metaephor here*) building a wall.  Everyone comes in to the room with a couple of bricks (ideas) and, together, even though you take one brick in the end to make a wall, everyone puts mini-bricks in to build it up.  And because the room is diverse, from developers and founders and designers, everyone's bricks are made of different...stuff?  And at the end of the week, you show some strangers the wall.  So, yeah.  Wall. **Remember to replace this metaphor**.

					<h4>Branding: research &amp; execution</h4>
					<p class="">
						With our ideas out on paper, I have a solid ground to quickly look at the branding.  To make prototypes as effective as possible for learning from users, they have to be as close to the real thing as possible.  Part of this means giving Gigbloc a cohesive brand.
					</p>	
					<p>
						To get a good &amp; quick understanding of how people see gigs I look at images on social networks to see what people associate with the word.

						I love that in design you're never finished learning.  These past two years have seen a plethora of prototyping tools created to help people test ideas in increasingly realistic ways.  Using them, I make the main prototype of the idea we picked and some prototypes of other ideas we liked.
