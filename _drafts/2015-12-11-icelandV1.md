			 			I didn't pay much attention in Science or Maths in school but combining my powers in both leads me to one clear &amp; undeniable fact.  Temperature under 0 = minus; Water freezes at minus; Human bodies are 70% water.  So when the weather report said it would be -7° during the warm hours &amp; -14° at night, I thought the end was nigh.

			 			Rekyavike is randomly twinned with my hometown of Hull.  There is a guide book about the UK called <a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/Crap-Towns-Worst-Places-Live/dp/0752215825">Crap Towns: 50 worst places to live</a>.  Hull 'won' first place.  I am from a town of winners.  So that + weather (more Maths) = negative high hopes.

Seeing the countryside you can kind of understand why NASA astronats like Neil Armstrong trained here.  I mean, why even bother going to the moon really Neil?  The same shit is here, fool.
