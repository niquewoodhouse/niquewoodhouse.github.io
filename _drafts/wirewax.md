							In a world where a million videos are published every day, Wirewax is a platform that lets anyone make their videos stand out from the crowd.  The main challenges were explaining to users how they could use a feature rich product &amp; designing for both free &amp; premium users needs.

						<p class="w80 fRight smallGapBott">
							Premium users wanted to create completely bespoke interactive video advertising &amp; I am priveleged to have designed something so many respected brands trusted.

		 			People use products because they let them do what they came to do, simply.  The more features a product has the more powerful it is but without the correct goals in place you can get a bloated product that no one can use, simply.  So I questioned each requested feature &amp; how to make it most useful &amp; easy to users.

		 			A lot of tech start ups think talking deeply about the tech helps sell the product but that can backfire.  My ultimate goal was to hide the technology behind a simple human interface. Show why the product is useful, not how.  That lets people focus on why they signed up in the first place.

					Wirewax was a big change in process for me.  
					After four straight years at creative agencies, I was used to having account managers to help sell every detail to the client &amp; project managers organising everything.

				<p class="w95 textJustify">
					At Wirewax, I had no one to sell or project manage.  
					Or tell the client no or that means a new deadline.  
					It taught me a lot about being open to change.  About being confident &amp; comfortable in the ambiguity &amp; unknwon of being a product in an agile way.
