						Some old colleagues are launching their own product - Gigbloc. They want a product design and brand to share with potential investors.  
					</p>
					<p class="">
						Constraints can help create simple solutions.  With this project I had minimal time - a week of evenings - and no real budget.  That makes a great opportunity to see what I can do after my day job, working in a minified <a href="https://designsprintkit.withgoogle.com/" target="_blank" class="underline">design sprint</a>.

					<h2>Diverge</h2>
					<p class="">
						I've always liked to sketch out concepts individually, but I've learned that this group stage .  What I liked about this phase is it proves good ideas can come from anyone on the team, and the team can make any idea better by collaborating upfront. 
					</p>
					<p>
					 It's like (*insert bad metaephor here*) building a wall.  Everyone comes in to the room with a couple of bricks (ideas) and, together, even though you take one brick in the end to make a wall, everyone puts mini-bricks in to build it up.  And because the room is diverse, from developers and founders and designers, everyone's bricks are made of different...stuff?  And at the end of the week, you show some strangers the wall.  So, yeah.  Wall. **Remember to replace this metaphor**.

					<h4>Branding: research &amp; execution</h4>
					<p class="">
						With our ideas out on paper, I have a solid ground to quickly look at the branding.  To make prototypes as effective as possible for learning from users, they have to be as close to the real thing as possible.  Part of this means giving Gigbloc a cohesive brand.
					</p>

						To get a good &amp; quick understanding of how people see gigs I look at images on social networks to see what people associate with the word.

					I really enjoyed the sprint aspects of this project.  We learned about what users might do but I also learned a lot about how I would like to design.

					Its a bit eye-opening to see how fast a team can move in these phases, and the individuals within the team.  Momentum and energy are two forces that I've never really consciously considered before as things that can propel a product forwards.  Definately something I want to take forward into my next project.
