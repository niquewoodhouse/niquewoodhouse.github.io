					<p class="">
						Some old colleagues were launching their own product - Gigbloc. They needed a design solution to share with potential investors.  
					</p>
					<p class="">
						Constraints can help create simple solutions.  With this project, I had minimal time and budget so it was a great opportunity to see what I can do over a week of evenings, after my day job, working in a tweaked <a href="https://designsprintkit.withgoogle.com/" target="_blank" class="underline">design sprint</a>.

						The first step in designing a product or a feature is understanding.  The context, the target users, the brief.  Ultimately, I need to understand the reason behind the brief  - <span class="bold">what is the actual problem we're solving and why should we solve it? </span>

						For the first draft, the more abstracted from a U.I these flows are, the better as it helps focus on the flow itself - getting that right.
					</p>	
					<p>
						What does the user want to achieve?  Ok, what do they need to actually help them do that?  By taking a step back from just starting to wireframe everything here you can streamline a user's journey and eventually save them time.
						And that's a big thing. <span class="ghost">Every second you save someone adds up to hours a year if they're regular users. </span>

				<div class="half l-m-b chapter l-m-t">
					<p class="">
						Understanding flows before wireframing things helps the team define what's in scope, and what isn't.  This is where the designer needs to collaborate and negotiate with the wider team.  There's no point now in wireframing or pixel perfecting buying tickets through the app if its something that we won't be able to build in the next 3 months.  Especially when time is of the essence.
					</p>	
					<p> 
						So I designed the agreed core flows and the co-founders decided to use Songkick’s API to locate gigs and Soundcloud’s API to play the performer's music.  So Gigbloc would be self-populating, to minimise work.
					</p>
					<p>
						Having defined the flows we wanted users to try, we sketched some U.I options, using the early emotion exploration to help decide which were the most effective.  I'd take those and create a couple of prototypes for testing with friends.

				<div class="unit half chapter s-p-l">
					<p class="heading">
						Always test early with your market.
					</p>
					<p class="w60">
						This helps you get on the right track, and helps remove any personal preference the designer, or anyone has.  What we do is about solving the user's problems. I took the wireframes we most liked and animated prototypes with <a href="http://principleformac.com/" target="_blank" class="underline">Principle</a>.  The more like the real experience the prototype can be, the better feedback you get.
					</p>
					<p class="w60">
						One of the prototypes, my favourite, tested the assumption we needed a map to show local music.
