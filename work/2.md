						Appear Here is the world’s leading marketplace for brands looking to rent retail space.  Thousands of brands looking at thousands of spaces around the world.  But, for a number of reasons, sometimes a brand doesn’t get the space it wants. Appear Here has a crack squad of people - the concierge team - who work in the marketplace to make bookings happen.  

					</p>	
					<h4>
						Just in London alone, over £2 milllion a week of possible rent is wasted because of empty spaces.

						Brands not matching to spaces was utlimately killing the marketplace.  If brands can't book a space, they'll leave the platform.  If spaces can't get bookings, they will look elsewhere.  With over 80% of brands struggling to find a space themselves, the ability of the concierge team to suggest spaces, and get them booked, was central to achieving the business goals.

						Well executed research reveals the real problems to solve.
						Most researchers begin with a set theory in mind and things that don't conflict or agree with that gets dismissed out of hand.  It's commonly called confirmation bias.  It can also happen during the research phase itself - picking up a few insights early, thinking you have a solution to them, and then for the rest of the By just recording as much data, qualitative and quantitative, as possible <em>and then</em> trying to find connections, I discover the deeper issues.  </p>

					<h2>A new way to meet your customer</h2>

							Putting the job into that communication context is integral to long-term relationship management.

					<h3>Save people time</h3>
					<p>
						For every experience, <em>every flow</em>, I try to ask myself "Do they need this? Does this help the user with their goal?".  Before, concierges were looking at a brand's wants &amp; then manually applying that to the spaces inventory to make suggestions.  It took an average of 3 minutes. 3 X 50 a day.  50 X 5 days a week.  Its a lot of time.
						With our solution, spaces would be pre-filtered according to a brand's wants - with all of the search &amp; filter controls consolidated in one place.

					<h3>Principle of reciprocity</h3>

				<div class="half m-m-b chapter m-auto">	
					<h3 class="">Building trust in edge cases</h3>
					<p class="">
						Designing a product involves not treating the unlikely incidencies as after thoughts.

						The interface brings the suggestions into a conversational context.  To save concierges' time, we'd include pre-written comments to support selections.  If a space had a success story from a similar brand, because from research we knew those stories inspired brands, we would drop it in as a comment automatically.  
					</p>	
				</div>
				<div class="half chapter m-m-t m-m-b m-auto">	
					<h3>Tighten the marketplace information loop</h3>			
					<p class="">
						At the start of this case study we looked at the 3 entities at the core of this marketplace - space, brand, concierge.  Even if a brand agrees with a suggested space, if that space says no to a brand, no booking has been made, putting us back to square one.
					</p>	
					<p>
						Through the research, it became clear that spaces repeatidely say no to brands for the same reasons.  It was a different reason for each space, but it was consistent for every space.  114 High St in New York (yes, its made up name) only wanted brands if the landlord could see their Instagram.   Of course, 114 High St would still reject some brands after seeing their feed.  But, with that information provided, a brands chances went from 0% to 50%.  That's huge.
					</p>
					<p>
						Here, when the brand first meets someone from Appear Here, we have a strong chance - <em>with that principle of reciprocity</em> - to plug those informtation gaps.

						The last step is sending your suggestions to the brand.  Its ultimately just completing the task but underneath that it is an optimum time to make the concierge feel good, celebrate their action &amp; let them know their choices are feeding the data model.

						Just like the relationship between the concierge &amp; the brand, the relationship between the concierge and all of this space data is becoming more human.  The more feedback they give the tool, the more they'll trust it to provide ever-improving suggestions.  
					</p>	
					<p>
						 Rewards to the most giving concierges starts new patterns of motivation.  Internal tools are a great opportunity for start-ups to reflect &amp; enhance their culture.  These simple details bring new patterns of motivation to that crack squad between the spaces and the brands.

			<h2>Positive start, much to do</h2>
			<p>
				The true impact of introducing a robust data model into the product is long term.   We're building something to help scale worldwide.  That kind of long-term planning is difficult in a busy start-up.  Indeed, midway through the first sprint for this work, the tech team pivoted to other product areas and I left Appear Here before they returned to it.
			</p>
			<p>
				I learned that designing tools that don't get made is unfortunate because the real-world learning is limited, but by testing at each fidelity stage you can still learn plenty.  I also learned that it is fine to have a big plan for where to take a product but, as a small team, its worth more to look at the constraints of where we are today and take iterative baby steps. When we did that, we impacted the bottom line.
