					<h2>Sprint from the start</h2>
					<p class="">
						Some old colleagues are re-launching their own product - Gigbloc. They want a product design and brand to share with potential investors, and work towards.

						Constraints can help create simple solutions.  With this project I had minimal time, and no real budget, or much access to the founders.  That makes for a great opportunity to see what I can do working in a minified <a href="https://designsprintkit.withgoogle.com/" target="_blank" class="underline">design sprint</a>.

						Take a step back when looking at flows because people use products to solve problems.  What was their problem, how did they discover your solution, what happens afterwards?  Context matters.

						I love that in design you're never finished learning.  Recent years have seen a plethora of prototyping tools created to help people test ideas in increasingly realistic ways.  I use them to make a high-fidelity prototype of our picked idea, and with left over time, some lower-fidelity versions of others we liked.
					</p>	
					<p>
						I like to make others because the more I can test, the more I can learn.  In this industry, costly mistakes can happen when we assume things.

					I used this as an opportunity to try out Framer to prototype the flows.  I found the learning curve a little steep to execute to the realistic level needed in a day, so I returned to Flinto which I was more familiar with.  Even with a small taste, Framer was very appealing to use and something I'll look to learn in my spare time for the next chance.

					When testing prototypes out in the wild its good to record responses audible (words, sighs, joyful yelps) &amp; non-audible responses (body language, facial expressions).  I test here for flows and emotions.  Gigbloc is a service people will use to find music they like.  That's a committment people make with their free time, which is really valuable to everyone.  So the emotional impact carries a significant influence in its success.

					I really enjoyed the sprint aspects of this project.  We learned about what users might do relatively cheaply and I personally learned a lot about how enjoyable designing like this can be.  Designing used to usually be a process where a designer gets a brief, disappears into a montage of pencil sharpening and paper crumpling, and returns from hibernation with a genius idea.  This sprint process feels smarter, or to be more precise, its a way to make mistakes quicker.   
				</p>					
				<p>
					Ultimately, the sprint is a process that forces you to keep momentum day by day and thus build up energy.  Those forces are powerful and being super aware of them is something I'll certainly be taking into my next project.
