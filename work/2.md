					<p class="">
						Appear Here is the world’s leading marketplace for brands looking for space to rent.  There are thousands of brands looking at thousands of spaces around the world.  But, for a number of reasons, sometimes a brand doesn’t get the space it wants.
					</p>	
					<h4 class="chapter">
						Just in London alone, over £2 milllion a week of possible rent is wasted because of empty spaces. 
					</h4>
					<p>
						Appear Here has a crack squad of people who work in the marketplace to make bookings happen.  This team help match spaces to brands.

						If a brand doesn’t get there preferred space, 84% of them freeze in the marketplace.   Brands not matching to spaces was costing resources, impacting revenue and ultimately stops brands from growing, ideas from happening, and cities from changing.

					<p class="bold">
						My mission was to affect these business level KPIs through a better system for concierges to suggest spaces to brands.

					<h3>Be confident that well executed research reveals the real problems to solve</h3>
					<p class="">
						Historically, most research begins with a theory in mind, and anything that doesn’t conflict or agree with that gets dismissed out of hand.  By just recording as much as possible <b>and then</b> trying to find connections, I discovered some deeper issues.
						<ul>
							<li>New concierges didn’t have the inherent knowledge of experienced concierges about spaces and brands.</li>
							<li>Data about spaces were in many different resources, its hard to know where to look let alone what to look for</li>
							<li>Most importantly for the business - as the business scales &amp; new concierge teams appear in major cities around the world, this issue will affect the bottom lines more.</li>

						For every experience, <em>every flow</em>, I try to ask myself "Do we need this? Does this help the user with their goal?".  Before concierges were looking at what a brand wanted &amp; then manually applying that to the spaces inventory to make suggestions.  It took a mininum of 3 minutes. 3*50 a day.  50*5 days a week.  Its a lot of resources.
						Now spaces would be pre-filtered according to what a brand wanted - with all of the search &amp; filter controls consolidated in one place.

					<h3>Principle of reciprocity</h3>

						People are more likely to give to those who have given them something already. If a waiter brings sweets with the bill, tips go up. With this design, I wanted to extend that beyond the screen by rewarding the most giving concierges with real life rewards.
					</p>
					<p> Just like the relationship between the concierge &amp; the brand, the relationship between the concierge and all this complicated data inventory is becoming more human.  The more they give the suggestion tool &amp; it gives back to them, the more they'll trust it to provide ever-improving suggestions.

					<h3 class="">Building trust in edge cases</h3>

					 Looking back on the original analysis, we understood this project as the first step in a relationship the concierge has with a brand.  But the brand’s judgement of the concierge’s value is made sooner - when they find out what a concierge is.  If you don't believe someone is an expert in your field, their words won't influence you so much.
