				<h2>Demistifying data</h2>
				<p class="">
					Wirewax had made video an interactive medium.  Viewers can tap on anything in a video to make something happen.  Tap a dress to buy it.  Tap an actor to see their credits.  It was all up to the creator of the video.  Huge brands used this technology to introduce their audience to new storytelling, or engage them even more.  
				</p>
				<p>
					These creators needed to know what their audience was interacting with.  When it came to the bigger brands, they needed bespoke information to identify their considerable ROI.  
				</p>

				<p class="s-print uppercase">Identify the point</p>
				<h2>Ask the right questions.</h2>
				<p>
					When it comes to any experience, especially data dashboards, its good to clearly identify why each data point is being shown?  Are we informing people? Are we just trying to show off? Does this measurement in anyway help them or does it just serve our own needs?

				<h3>Trust the process</h3>				
				<p>
					I had been wanting to work with data for a while.  The works of digital designers like <a href="http://feltron.com/" target="_blank" class="underline">Nicholas Feltron</a> &amp; <a href="http://oberhaeuser.info/" target="_blank" class="underline">Martin Oberh√§user</a> showed that real data could be as stunning as it could be informative.  My first task was research across three key areas - what data can we show; what data would be helpful; how can data be displayed.

				<h3>If you're designing something you've not designed before, in an new industry, stick to your process.</h3>
				<p>
					<b>Research &#8702; Insights &#8702; Ideate &#8703; Test &#8702; Execute</b><br>
					Uncovering what data can we show involved working with the data science team and senior management to identify what's possible for <em>every</em> video. Its important, from the start, you're not just considering the preferrable states of things.  These videos are user generated content.  These metrics will be created by viewers.  We have super limited control over both.  You have to be doubly concious of it when designing a professional tool.  People are depending on your product for their jobs. 
				</p>
				<p>
					To understand what data would be helpful involved researching our users, and working with the sales team to get a picture of what moves the needle when they're selling the platform.  To its credit, Wirewax was a rarity in the 2015 London start up scene, in making a considerable consistent profit.  So that information was crucial.

				<p class="s-print uppercase">The solution</p>
				<h2>Identify the experiences</h2>
				<p>
					We used a chapter system to break the data down into bitesize info around themes and reduce cognitive load. 
				</p>

				<p>
					<b>Views - </b><br>
					A section all about your viewers.  When they view, how they view, where they view.  Even though this had nothing much to do with the interactive video elements, which is why they use the SaaS platform, its very important to our users.
				</p>
				<p>
					<b>Interactions - </b><br>
					Are your viewers interacting with the video?  When are they?  How often?  This is where we can add value to our USP - making any video interactive.
				</p>				
				<p>
					<b>Engagaement - </b><br>
					Because viewers could interact with a video, their experience would change.  A 1 minute video could become a 5 minute experience, because viewers tap on a dress, see if its in stock nearby, and buy it.  This is where the more high value users would spend more to get more information because, in 2015, capturing someone's attention online, was really the prime KPI for many businesses.

			<h2>Inform</h2>
			<p>
				A SaaS product needs to deliver strong, clear metrics to users to let them evaluate their success.  The more success they have, the more the product benefits.  But failure is just as important to record and reveal.  That's how people get better.

			<h2>Educate</h2>
			<p>
				This is probably the most important theme for retention of our users.  Retention is key to SaaS platforms.  The more we can educate our users on how to improve their interactive videos, the more ROI they'll get on the videos and ultimately, the more they'll use the platform.  Its not that we're expecting bad videos

			<p>
				We wanted users to visualise the success of their tags in the video timeline, so they could assertain where to put them.  Wirewax was a leading figure in interactive video, the founders speaking at several conferences a year around the world.  So the team had great insights into what a good interactive video looked like.  But it was important to let the data tell people the truth and that we got out of the way.

			<h2>Get paid</h2>
			<p>
				SaaS growth depends on both getting and retaining more users, and providing those users more tools for an additional fee.  As a small start up it was sometimes these bespoke ideas for metrics that helped win long term contracts with people like Amazon &amp; NBC Universal.  
			</p>
			<p>
				As ever, its a case of following that process of getting insights, ideating and testing.  We didn't end up building many of these ideas but they helped the team become stronger on the practice of taking real data and putting it into a visual story to empower users.  It came to the point where we could have a prototype of a concept within a day to help win the contract.

				As the only designer at a startup, especially one with offices in multuple countries, you have to learn strong time management, be aware of your weaknesses and work on them when you can.  I hadn't really worked with data before, to this level.  And certainly, it took a little time to realise the context of this data.
