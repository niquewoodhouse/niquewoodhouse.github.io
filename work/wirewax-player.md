					<p class="heading">The problem to solve</p>
					<p class="">
						Consistency leads to expectation.  After so many years of digital experiences we all expect every new e-commerce experience to be essentially the same.  Even if its a totally new brand to us, if its not essentially the same as every brand's online shop we do know, we're not going to take the time to learn it, to adapt.  We'll just go somewhere else.
					</p>
					<p class="">
						Video players are the same.  We expect controls at the bottom; a scrubber so we can speed to the good bits or skip the boring ones; a time stamp.  Tens of tiny things we've been trained to anticipate that we don't even realise until something breaks those expectations.
					</p>	
					<p class="">
						And it makes total sense for video players to be the same.  Not just because its easier for us all to then be entertained by the content.  Its because the content is all the same, really.  The material is different, sure, but the underlying concept is the same from Tellytubies to Terminator.  You press play, sit back and watch. 
					</p>	
					<p class="emphasis">	
						Wirewax videos aren't like that.

					Its a product that lets people make anything in any video interactive.  So the watching experience stops being purely passive. With Wirewax videos, you can interact with potentially anything in the video.   
						<span class="emphasis">We're designing an experience that doesn't exist yet.</span>

					<p class="heading">Respect the constraints, recognise where to innovate </p>
